# Text classification with basic RNN

This is my first try to NLP. I used very simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model and tried text classification for the Kaggle data which can be found from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishqdublish/text-classification-documentation.
The accuracy of the model is little bit over 50%, which is quite low. Next I should try LSTM and transformers.
